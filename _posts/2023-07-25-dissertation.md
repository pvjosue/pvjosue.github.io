## Abstract

This work integrates computational sciences and microscopy to develop real-time 3D fluorescent imaging tools for living specimens, such as zebrafish neural activity. We employed tools like a light-field microscope, deep and Bayesian learning, and joint optimization of the optical system and reconstruction algorithm. Also, we present a set of tools for research project organization, including subjects like time and hardware management and experiment repeatability.
