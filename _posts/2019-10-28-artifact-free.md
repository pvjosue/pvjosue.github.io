## Abstract

The sampling patterns of the light field microscope (LFM) are highly depth-dependent, which implies non-uniform recoverable lateral resolution across depth. Moreover, reconstructions using state-of-the-art approaches suffer from strong artifacts at axial ranges, where the LFM samples the light field at a coarse rate. In this work, we analyze the sampling patterns of the LFM, and introduce a flexible light field point spread function model (LFPSF) to cope with arbitrary LFM designs. We then propose a novel aliasing-aware deconvolution scheme to address the sampling artifacts. We demonstrate the high potential of the proposed method on real experimental data.
