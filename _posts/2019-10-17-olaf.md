## Abstract

oLaF is a flexible Matlab framework for 3D reconstruction of light field microscopy data. It is designed to cope with various LFM configurations in terms of MLA type (regular vs. hexagonal grid, single-focus vs. mixed multi-focus lenslets) and MLA placement in the optical path (original 1.0 vs. defocused 2.0 LFM designs). oLaF can be found at https://gitlab. lrz. de/IP/olaf.
